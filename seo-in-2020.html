     <h1>SEO in 2020</h1><br>
     <p>Let's start with the basics. 
      Let's explain what SEO is first and foremost before dwelling deeper into what's to come to the field in 
      the coming year.<br> So, SEO stands for 'Search Engine Optimization', while someone unfamiliar with the
      field might think that we are optimizing the search engine, that assumption is actually, incorrect.
      Unless you are working for Google or Bing webmasters, then you might get to see the action from the other side. 
      What we do, is optimize our websites. Or our clients sites, in order to fight up for the number one position
      on Googles SERP(Search Engine Results Page). This is my definition of it. A very simple one.<br><br> Now, there's
      actually a ton of work that goes into this process. And it can take anywhere from 3 to 6 months for the
      first, results really, to appear. This includes working everyday, depending on the niche that the website
      is focused on, what you do as an SEO Expert, is you conduct research, analysis, tests and you track what 
      other competitors are doing. <br>The strategy is to outwit the competition, by sifting thoroughly
      through a lot of data and making smart decisions based on that data, maybe a little bit of luck and you 
      can get the number one spot on the SERP. Now, don't get any ideas about trying to use dirty tactics. 
      There's no such thing in practical SEO. <br>Google is always keeping an eye, on every website and page it 
      crawls, it's algorithms are so advanced that virtually there's very little human intervention, basically
      the web is run and policed by bots. For good or bad, "Google is the God of the Internets". 
      They can detect any foul play and your site will get penalized and loose rank, therefore, you loose 
      your user or customer base. Depending on if you are selling something on your site or just providing 
      content. It's not all that bad though, Google has a webmasters blog, where you can go and inform yourself 
      or just read the latest news about what's changed from an SEO perspective.
     </p><br><br>
     <h2>What makes up SEO?</h2><br>
     <p>This is a really good question for a newcomer to the field to ask. Generally, when you ask some SEO
      expert or someone who has been in the field for a couple of years, they will probably say something like
      <i>SEO can be divided into two main parts, and they are as follows. Technical SEO and Local SEO.</i>
      Now, if we take a closer look at Technical SEO, it's actually comprised of two sub parts. On-page SEO 
      and Off-page SEO.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>On-page SEO</li>
      </ul><br>
      Working on this part, means that your main focus in your SEO strategy is the Website or Web page. That is,
      you will work strictly on improving the page. You preform your initial SEO analysis, you write down any
      issues you come upon, you research what and how things can be improved, you test, do another analysis and
      if you are satisfied with the results, you implement your practices.<br>
      <ul><br>
        <li>On-page SEO</li>
      </ul><br>
      This on the other hand, means as the name suggests, you work outside of the site or page in order to increase
      the visibility of the site. With that, you increase traffic and improve the rank and domain authority. In both
      parts, you have your target keywords that you want to rank for, and you work your way into getting a higher
      rank for those target keywords. In one part, you do that from the site or page, in the other you do that from
      outside the page.<br><br>

      <p1 style="font-weight: bold;">With that being cleared up a bit, here are the top 5 things to focus on in 2020 from an SEO perspective.</p1><br><br>

      <h3>Voice Search</h3><br>
      <h3>Video</h3><br>
      <h3>Visual Search</h3><br>
      <h3>User Content</h3><br>
      <p>With the recent relese of BERT algorithm, Google is more focused on user friendly content more than ever
        before. And you should be too.
      </p><br>
