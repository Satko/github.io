    <h1>What this website is about</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p1>After working in <a href="https://slicelife.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#D84526;">Slice</a> as an SEO Analyst for a couple of months, I was inspired to build this website to test out my SEO knowledge
     that I have acquired and hone my web development skills. I plan to expand the site besides SEO content and write about computer science, technologies and techniques.
    <br> <br>
    <div class="text-center">

    <h2>About me</h2><br> I was born and raised in N. Macedonia. I fell in love with computers through video games. It all started in 2002 when the
     latest Command & Conquer Generals hit the shelves. I got a PC shortly after and soon discovered the possibilities that computers
     can offer, besides spending all day building bases and playing Generals. I realized how powerful a computer can be, that it can be
     given commands to perform any task that you want. In 2008 I started writing basic batch files, it was really fun messing with them
     and creating simple but fun things for me at the time. After I started high school, we had a Pascal<i>(for those of you wondering what this is, don't look it up.)</i> and C++ programming course.
     Ever since I was absolutely blown away by what could be accomplished through these seemingly cryptic languages. For some reasons
     whenever I would try and work on some language for a couple of months, something would happen and just knock me back off track. Then
     I'd just try to take a new language for a spin... Although I haven't mastered any, I have to say, I'm kind of proud that I have touched or read upon around 6 of them. For the record, there are hundreds of
     programming languages. Most people only need to know anywhere from 1-3, depending on which field they want to work in the world of computers.<br><br>
    <i>For example:</i> If you work in <i>Web Development</i>, you will certainly need JavaScript, 2-3 of the frameworks that seemingly popup everymonth, but no worries
     just pick one of the popular ones, you can find which ones are trending at the moment by simply doing a google search and just roll with that. The important thing is,
     you have to start from somewhere and work with it. You have to practice everyday, for at least 1-2 hours, I gurantee you, you can become
     comfortable with whatever you choose if you work with it everyday, for months. Then, there are tons of free online courses that you can pick, do some of those,
     ask people who work in the field for tips and advice. I'm sure most would be happy to help you out. In 1 year, you could land yourself a Junior Developer Job.
     Now, lets go to Python with Django or Flask. You can also web development with Python and the help of these frameworks. I haven't really tried it so,
     I can't speak from experience, like I said above, you have tons of courses online which can teach you the basics for free and after that just start working 
     on some ideas in order to expand your experience and knowledge. For <i>Data Analysis</i>, you will need Python and some of the numerous frameworks, or R. For <i>System Programming</i>
     you could employ C, C++, Rust, and many others... For <i>Game Programming</i> you could either build your own engine using whatever language you feel comfortable with
     or if you use Game engines like <i>Unity or Unreal</i>, you will need C# or C++. This goes on and on but I'll stop here and hope that you get the point.
     You can use a number of languages for any task, some are easier to use for certain things, all you need to do is research it.
    <br><br>
     So, after a long time of putting this project off, and multiple tries, I have finally decided to develop this website, from scratch by using HTML and
     CSS + Bootstrap and may even include some JavaScript as the website develops. I also wanted to have a playground where I'm able
     to test out my SEO skills.</p1></div>
