<h3>Google, Bing or Apple? Where to set up my listing?</h3>
For starters, Google is your best bet, it's the best optimized and user friendly way. And to be honest,
Google is the biggest search engine so, that's where most of your traffic will come from. Once you 
understand the basic princples of how listings work, you can move on to Bing Places or Apple Maps since 
it's prety much the same principles. But yeah, you can only do Google and you'll be good.

<h3>how to claim your listings</h3>
>>>>>>>>>> ADD IMAGE OF CLAIM GOOGLE MY BUSINESS<<<<<<<<<

If you are the owner of a certain physical office, store or a shop that offers services, odds are,
your business is already on Google. Google uses its users feedback, to enable it to create business
profiles online automatically, or, any owner of a business can go online and create it himself, see below.
It can also use information from other sites, like Yelp, Tripadvisor, etc.

To find out if Google has already created a listing for your business, type your store name and address
in the search bar, hit enter and voila! If there is one, great, if not, no cause for corncearn, you can
create it yourself, which is very simple and straighforward process and takes up a few minutes. 

First, if you have the business profile of your store open on Google, go and click on Own this business? 
link. If the listing hasn't been claimed by anyone else, then you can simply follow the steps and fill in 
your information and, in about a week(takes longer outside the US), Gooogle will send you a Google My Business 
postcard that contains a pin number needed to verify that you are indeed the owner of the location, 
hence gain access to your Google My Business profile.

<h3>what checks to perform as soon as you have verified your listing</h3>

Once you log in, you may check your infromation, make the neccessary changes, and click on the update button.
<<<<<<<<<<<< ADD IMAGE OF GOOGLE MY BUSINESS VERIFIED PROFILE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

-Make sure to head into the info tab and check if your name, address, phone number and schedule matches 
your physical location. Next, when someone searches for a store or business online, they usually like to 
see photos of the location, what it looks like outside, inside, products, if you offer some. 
So, once logged in  your Google My Business profile, you can go to Photos, and upload a few clear photos 
of your bussiness, make sure your profile photo feautures your stroe front, add your logo and add some 
photos of the inside  or the products that you offer.
Once that is done, you can go ahead and update your website, if you have one, which at this point, I'm just 
going to assume you do.
