POST 1:Mobile Friendly Sites

<h1>Mobile Friendly Sites</h1>
<br><br>
<p>Smartphones have changed the world and still continue to do. This had a huge effect on the Web, especially. With Smartphones overtaking Personal Computers in a lot of countries all over the world.
So, in 2015, Google, in order to motivate people to start developing their websites with mobile being the first thing to optimize for, started to reward websites that were built with Mobile Friendliness in mind.
<br>
<br>
<blockquote cite="https://www.inc.com/samuel-edwards/it-s-official-google-to-reward-mobile-friendly-websites.html">
On February 26, Google made an important two-part announcement on its official blog. While the overall takeaway is that Google wants websites to be 
mobile-friendly, there are two important changes to understand:
More mobile-friendly websites in search results.
More relevant app content in search results.
Now, it's important to understand that Google is not referring to desktop rankings. This announcement is in reference to mobile search rankings,
specifically. However, there is a lot of speculation from reputable sources that mobile-friendliness will impact desktop rankings in the near future, as well.
It's also unclear whether or not Google will be adjusting its rankings on a page-by-page or site-wide basis. This could be an important distinction 
for websites that have separate mobile sites or versions. The safest way for site owners to ensure they're properly optimized is to pay attention to 
all site pages.
According to Robert Ramirez, SEO Manager at Bruce Clay, Inc., this announcement is critical for everyone and ultimately points towards the need to adopt 
responsive design. "As Google's preferred method of serving content to mobile users, we can assume that responsive sites will be favored by Google in 
search results going forward, and this is the first real step in that process," Ramirez said. Furthermore, he suggests that if it's not possible to make 
your site responsive by April 21, you should--at the very least--address the deficiencies of your existing mobile solution.

This had a huge effect on the Dev world. And today, in 2020, if your website is not optimized for Handheld devices, it may take a hit in ranking due to 
Google policies that enforce these rules. Even if its ranking is not affected, it's a bad practice to have a website, no matter what it's purpose is in 2020 
without optimizing it for Mobile devices. If you don't, you'll be missing out on a lot of benefits, like increased link authority, rank and an ever-growing customer base.
A lot of people started to focus on how to best optimize their websites so they can be displayed right no matter what device they were viewed from, and 
this encouraged people to build and come up with all kinds of software-based solutions with frameworks like Bootstrap, a CSS frameworks which utilizes 
HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels, etc. Which I use on this site. 
There also a ton of JavaScript and TypeScript frameworks that enable fast and smooth web development like Express, React, Angular, Vue and many more. 
JavaScript is not the only language with a big focus on web development... There are also frameworks for Python, PHP, Ruby, and others. Which one you will 
use, is up to your preferences. - Now, I don't have any experience with any of the programming language based frameworks afro mentioned so, take this information 
with a pinch of salt. I'm sure that if some experienced developers are reading this they'll be laughing. But hey, I'm open to feedback so, feel free to contact me to correct the information.
You see, all of these solutions were made to make it easier for software and web developers, without having to set them up from zero, you should really be taking advantage of them. If you are a developer that is.
<br>
<br>
<blockquote cite="from https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites">How much does it cost to build a site for mobile devices?
It varies. For example, here are some of the possibilities:
Going mobile can be free if you can select a responsive template or theme for your website. A responsive template or theme adapts the display to the 
visitor no matter if they are using a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
Going mobile can be free if you have the technical skills to build your mobile site. Check out Web Fundamentals.
Going mobile will likely cost time and money if you need to hire a developer. Furthermore, if your website was created several years ago, a new developer 
might recommend starting from scratch (so you'll be paying for a complete makeover). This is because there are new web development techniques 
and themes (or page templates) that may make it more efficient to re-do -- rather than modify -- your site. This is especially the case for sites:
 -Built with Flash
 -Using outdated e-commerce platforms
The good news is that if you start from scratch there may be an existing template or theme that you can utilize. You may be able to reuse your 
existing content which can hopefully save time and money.

So, as you can see, it's not difficult to change a desktop-oriented site into a mobile-friendly one, if you can do it yourself, you should 
do so asap. If not, you can pay a developer to that for you. The point is, your website has to be mobile-friendly as smartphones are getting 
more accessible and people are more likely to buy one instead of buying a personal computer.
According to Google: In the USA, 94% of people with smartphones search for local information on their phones. Interestingly, 77% of mobile 
searches occur at home or at work, places where desktop computers are likely to be present.

Now about the actual impact it has on SEO.

After working in <a href="https://slicelife.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#D84526;">Slice</a> as an SEO Analyst for a couple of months, I was inspired to build this website to test out my SEO knowledge
     that I have acquired and hone my web development skills. I plan to expand the site besides SEO content and write about computer science, technologies and techniques.
     <br> <br>
     <h2>About me</h2><br> I was born and raised in N. Macedonia. I fell in love with computers through video games. It all started in 2002 when the
     latest Command & Conquer Generals hit the shelves. I got a PC shortly after and soon discovered the possibilities that computers
     can offer, besides spending all day building bases and playing Generals. I realized how powerful a computer can be, that it can be
     given commands to perform any task that you want. In 2008 I started writing basic batch files, it was really fun messing with them
     and creating simple but fun things for me at the time. After I started high school, we had a Pascal<i>(for those of you wondering what this is, don't look it up.)</i> and C++ programming course.
     Ever since I was absolutely blown away by what could be accomplished through these seemingly cryptic languages. For some reasons
     whenever I would try and work on some language for a couple of months, something would happen and just knock me back off track. Then
     I'd just try to take a new language for a spin... Although I haven't mastered any, I have to say, I'm kind of proud that I have touched or read upon around 12 of them. Yes. There are hundreds of
     programming languages. Most people only need to know anywhere from 2-5 to be able to work in most fields in the world of computers.<br><br>
     <i>For example:</i> If you work in <b>Web Development</b>, you will need JavaScript, 2-3 of the frameworks that seemingly popup everymonth(good luck with that),
     or Python with Django or Flask. For <b>Data Analysis</b>, you will need Python and some of the numerous frameworks, or R. For <b>System Programming</b>
     you could employ C, C++, Rust, and many others... For <b>Game Programming</b> you could either build your own engine using whatever language you feel comfortable with
     or if you use Game engines like <i>Unity or Unreal</i>, you will need C# or C++. This goes on and on but I'll stop here and hope that you get the point.
     You can use a number of languages for any task, some are easier to use for certain things, all you need to do is research it.
     <br><br>
     So, after a long debate with myself, and multiple tries, I have finally decided to build this website, from scratch by using HTML and
     CSS + Bootstrap may even include some JavaScript as the website develops. I also wanted to have a playground where I'm able
     to test out my SEO skills.</p></div>
