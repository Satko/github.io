POST 1:Mobile Friendly Sites

<h1>Mobile Friendly Sites</h1>
<br><br>
<p>In recent years, every article or tutorial about web development you might have seen, probably mentioned 
that your site should be mobile friendly, but why is that? After these devices that we call smartphones took 
over our lives and the  world, somewhere around 2014, Google saw an ever increasing customer base viewing pages 
from their mobile devices. Although there were a lot of mobile-friendly sites out there, not all of them were 
really optmized for mobile. Since Google is kind of, the 'boss' when it comes to the presentation of the 
internet, they've decided in order to support this booming new mobile world, that every website should be 
ompimized for a handheld device, just as it is for desktops. Anyone not following these guidlines, gets 
punished by the Google crawler and indexing algorithms and their ranking on SERP takes the blow. 
Now you know why it is so, let's explore 'why you should be doing it! Mobile-friendly indexing is all the 
rage these days. If you get on this train early, Google will 'reward' you by pushing your content higher on 
the SERP

After working in <a href="https://slicelife.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#D84526;">Slice</a> as an SEO Analyst for a couple of months, I was inspired to build this website to test out my SEO knowledge
     that I have acquired and hone my web development skills. I plan to expand the site besides SEO content and write about computer science, technologies and techniques.
     <br> <br>
     <h2>About me</h2><br> I was born and raised in N. Macedonia. I fell in love with computers through video games. It all started in 2002 when the
     latest Command & Conquer Generals hit the shelves. I got a PC shortly after and soon discovered the possibilities that computers
     can offer, besides spending all day building bases and playing Generals. I realized how powerful a computer can be, that it can be
     given commands to perform any task that you want. In 2008 I started writing basic batch files, it was really fun messing with them
     and creating simple but fun things for me at the time. After I started high school, we had a Pascal<i>(for those of you wondering what this is, don't look it up.)</i> and C++ programming course.
     Ever since I was absolutely blown away by what could be accomplished through these seemingly cryptic languages. For some reasons
     whenever I would try and work on some language for a couple of months, something would happen and just knock me back off track. Then
     I'd just try to take a new language for a spin... Although I haven't mastered any, I have to say, I'm kind of proud that I have touched or read upon around 12 of them. Yes. There are hundreds of
     programming languages. Most people only need to know anywhere from 2-5 to be able to work in most fields in the world of computers.<br><br>
     <i>For example:</i> If you work in <b>Web Development</b>, you will need JavaScript, 2-3 of the frameworks that seemingly popup everymonth(good luck with that),
     or Python with Django or Flask. For <b>Data Analysis</b>, you will need Python and some of the numerous frameworks, or R. For <b>System Programming</b>
     you could employ C, C++, Rust, and many others... For <b>Game Programming</b> you could either build your own engine using whatever language you feel comfortable with
     or if you use Game engines like <i>Unity or Unreal</i>, you will need C# or C++. This goes on and on but I'll stop here and hope that you get the point.
     You can use a number of languages for any task, some are easier to use for certain things, all you need to do is research it.
     <br><br>
     So, after a long debate with myself, and multiple tries, I have finally decided to build this website, from scratch by using HTML and
     CSS + Bootstrap may even include some JavaScript as the website develops. I also wanted to have a playground where I'm able
     to test out my SEO skills.</p></div>
