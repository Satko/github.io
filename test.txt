2. Optimize your listings
• am I eliglible for a listing profile?

Eligible businesses
In order to qualify for a Business Profile on Google, a business must make in-person contact with customers during its stated hours.

There are some exceptions:

ATMs, video-rental kiosks, and express mail dropboxes are permitted. If you add these locations, you must include contact information for customers to get help.
Seasonal businesses, like an ice-skating rink only open in winter months, are eligible. These businesses must display permanent signage at their location year-round.
Virtual Kitchens are permitted. Virtual Kitchens are professional food preparation and cooking facilities set up to prepare delivery-only meals via third-party services. They are also referred to as Ghost Kitchens and Cloud Kitchens. A Virtual Kitchen should create their Business Profile as a service area business.
Ineligible businesses
The following businesses are not eligible for a business listing:

Rental or for-sale properties such as vacation homes, model homes, or vacant apartments. Sales or leasing offices, however, are eligible for verification.
An ongoing service, class, or meeting at a location that you don't own or have the authority to represent.
Lead generation agents or companies. - from Google  >>>> google.com

- Google, Bing or Apple? Where to set up my listing?
For starters, Google is your best bet, it's the best optimized and user friendly way. And to be honest,
Google is the biggest search engine so, that's where most of your traffic will come from. Once you 
understand the basic princples of how listings work, you can move on to Bing Places or Apple Maps since 
it's prety much the same principles.

• how to claim your listings

• what checks to perform as soon as you have verified your listing
-Make sure to head into the info tab and check if your name, address, phone number and schedule matches 
your physical location. Next, when someone searches for a store or business online, they usually like to 
see photos of the location, what it looks like outside, inside, some products, if you offer some. 
So, once logged in  your Google My Business profile, you can go to Photos, and upload a few clear photos 
of your bussiness, make sure your profile photo feautures your stroe front, add your logo and add some 
photos of the inside  or the products that you offer.
Once that is done, you can go ahead and update your website, if you have one, which at this point, I'm just 
going to assume you do.
• ok, so now you have updated your listing, and everything is looking good, what now?
