                <p>Let me share some history about me and what inspired me to develop this.<br>
                   My name is Sadmin Durmishi, I was born and raised in Macedonia. As in, the Republic of Macedonia.
                   Before diving in, I'd like to make it clear that I'm an adventurer at heart above all else.  
                   I love being outdoors exploring and hiking, however, I fell in love with computers through 
                   video games. It all started in 2002 when the latest Command & Conquer game, Generals hit the shelves.<br><br>
                   I got a PC shortly after and soon discovered the possibilities that computers can offer, besides 
                   spending all day building bases and playing Generals.... I realized how a computer can do more,
                   so much more, than just display and calculate the amount and positions of polygons on the screen,
                   that, there are languages, built by people in order to comunicate and give instructions to it. 
                   Just like the games that I've been playing, a computer could perform a lot of other tasks and, 
                   with a little bit of passion, studying and trying out examples of some really simple things like,
                   VBS and batch files, I would try to impress my friends and, hopefully, I'll seem like a wizard to them.
                   <br><br>
                   After I started high school, we had a Pascal<i>(for those of you 
                   wondering what this is, don't Google it :P)</i> and C++ programming course. 
                   Ever since, I was absolutely blown away by what could be accomplished through these 
                   seemingly cryptic languages. For some reasons whenever I would try and work on some language 
                   for a couple of months, something would happen and knock me off track.<br><br>
                   Then I'd try to take a new language for a spin... The most experience I had with programming, was
                   with the C language. I absolutely love C, even though I haven't mastered it. I have to say, 
                   I'm kind of proud that I have experimented with around 6 of them. For the record, there are 
                   hundreds of programming languages. Most people only need to know anywhere from 1-3, depending on 
                   which field they want to work in the world of Computer Science and Technologies (soon to be our 
                   machine overlords :/).</p><br>

                <h2>What is the purpose of this website?</h2><br>
                <p>After working at <a href="https://slicelife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slice</a> as an SEO Analyst 
                  for a year and a half, I was inspired to build this website to test out my SEO knowledge
                  that I have acquired over that period and hone my existing web development skills. 
                  I plan to expand the site besides SEO content and write about computer science, technologies and techniques.
                  I'll be mentioning SEO a lot throughout the site so, for those of you not familiar
                  with the term, it stands for: Search Engine Optimization. I have been putting this project off 
                  for a long time but finally, I decided to build this site, from scratch  by using Boilerplate 
                  HTML5 and CSS3 + Bootstrap 4 and may even include some hand crafted JavaScript as the website 
                  develops, besides the external scripts used now. I also wanted to have a playground where I'm able 
                  to test out my SEO skills, fron-tend and back-end development. Building this site showed me how 
                  much effort actually goes into all the sites and web apps we use on a daily basis without much 
                  of a thought about how things actually work.</p><br><br>
                  <h3>What makes a website attractive to people in 2020?</h3><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Page Speed</li>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Reliability</li>
                    <li>Engagement</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Lets's go over them a little bit.<br><br>
                  1. Page Speed: In today's modern and fast-paced world, people have less and less time for waiting. 
                  And justifiably so, as we are constantly bombarded with all sorts of information, work, and all 
                  the other things that life throws at us.
                  With that in mind, your website should load fast because people don't have time to wait for it to 
                  load. They want information and they want it fast. Make sure your site meets today's standards.<br><br>
                  2. Inheritance: Means the users have all the information available to them on your site. 
                  Everything should be accessible no matter where it's located on your site and no matter 
                  what device they are viewing it from.<br><br>
                  3. Reliability: Users expect your site and the content presented on it to be reliable, at all times. 
                  Make sure to design it for slow and intermittent content.<br><br>
                  4. User Engagement: What this refers to is that the content presented on your site should be easy 
                  for the average user or customer to understand. The UI of the website must be friendly to the eyes, 
                  and finally it should keep your audience to keep coming back to your site.<br></p>
