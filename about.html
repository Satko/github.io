              <h1>What this website is about<br></h1>
              <p><br>After working in Slice as an SEO Analyst for a couple of months, I was inspired to build this website to test out my SEO knowledge
               that I have acquired and hone my web development skills. I plan to expand the site besides SEO content and write about computer
               science news and technologies and techniques.<br>
               <br>About me - I was born and raised in N. Macedonia. I fell in love with computers through video games. It all started in 2002 when the
               latest Command & Conquer Generals hit the shelves. I got a PC shortly after and soon discovered the possibilities that computers
               can offer, besides spending all day building bases and playing Generals. I realized how powerful a computer can be, that it can be
               given commands to perform any task that you want. In 2008 I started writing basic batch files, it was really fun messing with them
               and creating simple but fun things for me at the time. After I started high school, we had a Pascal and C++ programming course.
               Ever since I was absolutely blown away by what could be accomplished through these seemingly cryptic languages.<br>
               <br>So, after a long debate with myself, and multiple tries, I have finally decided to build this website, from scratch by using HTML and
               CSS + Bootstrap may even include some JavaScript as the website develops. I also wanted to have a playground where I could be able
               to test out my SEO skills.</p></div>
