                <h1>About me</h1><br> 
                <img src="sadmin_durmishi-about.webp" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 20px;" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="Me, enjoying the view over the valley">
                <p>I was born and raised in North Macedonia. First, I want to say that I'm and adventurer at heart above
                   all else.  I love being outdoors, exploring, hiking however, I fell in love with computers through 
                   video games. It all started in 2002(aged 7) when the latest Command & Conquer Generals hit the shelves. 
                   I got a PC shortly after and soon discovered the possibilities that computers can offer, besides 
                   spending all day building bases and playing Generals. I realized how powerful a computer can be, 
                   that it can begiven commands to perform any task that you want. In 2008(aged 13) I started writing 
                   basic batch files, it was fun messing with them and creating simple but fun things for me at the time. 
                   After I started high school, we had a Pascal<i>(for those of you wondering what this is, don't 
                   look it up.)</i> and C++ programming course. Ever since I was absolutely blown away by what could be 
                   accomplished through these seemingly cryptic languages. For some reasons whenever I would try and 
                   work on some language for a couple of months, something would happen and knock me back off track. 
                   Then I'd try to take a new language for a spin... Although I haven't mastered any, I have to say, 
                   I'm kind of proud that I have touched or read upon around 6 of them. For the record, there are 
                   hundreds of programming languages. Most people only need to know anywhere from 1-3, depending on 
                   which field they want to work in the world of our machine overlords.</p><br>
                <h2>How this all came to be</h2><br>
                <p>After a long time of putting this project off , I decided to develop this website, from scratch 
                  by using HTML and CSS + Bootstrap and may even include some hand crafted JavaScript as the website 
                  develops, besides the external scripts used now. I also wanted to have a playground where I'm able 
                  to test out my SEO skills, frontend and backend development. Building this site has showed me how 
                  much effort actually goes into all the sites and web apps we use on a daily basis without much 
                  of a thought about how things actually work.</p><br>
                <h3>My skills include</h3><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>On Page SEO</li>

                </ul>
                <br><br>
                <p>I'm familiar with a lot of tools used in the SEO world in order to get the most out of  it. If you
