                <h1>About us</h1><br>
                <p>SADSTORM was born out of an idea, to simply improve and test out various SEO technologies, tips and techniques.
                  Oh... and, the desire to learn.</p><br><br>
                <h2>What is the purpose of this website?</h2><br>
                <p>The goal of SADSTORM.com is simple. That is, to become a site and blog about sharing experiences, knowledge and stories 
                  from a variety of topics, including Search Engine Optmization, programming, experiences in various other 
                  fields, what is new in Technology, Movies, Games and stories that will captivate you, from all around the web, 
                  gathered in one place, accessible and enjoyable for the casual reader. Did I mention that the content
                  is without any sort of distractions?! That's right, you can enjoy this site without any pop up
                  windows jumping at you, or those weird boxes obscuring 20% of the page, nor pesky adds...</p><br><br>
                  <h3>What makes a website attractive to people in 2020?</h3><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Page Speed</li>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Reliability</li>
                    <li>Engagement</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Lets's go over them a little bit.<br><br>
                  1. <b>Page Speed:</b> In today's modern and fast-paced world, people have less and less time for waiting. 
                  And justifiably so, as we are constantly bombarded with all sorts of information, work, and all 
                  the other things that life throws at us.
                  With that in mind, your website should load fast because people don't have time to wait for it to 
                  load. They want information and they want it fast. Make sure your site meets today's standards.<br><br>
                  2. <b>Inheritance:</b> Means the users have all the information available to them on your site. 
                  Everything should be accessible no matter where it's located on your site and no matter 
                  what device they are viewing it from.<br><br>
                  3. <b>Reliability:</b> Users expect your site and the content presented on it to be reliable, at all times. 
                  Make sure to design it for slow and intermittent content.<br><br>
                  4. <b>User Engagement:</b> What this refers to is that the content presented on your site should be easy 
                  for the average user or customer to understand. The UI of the website must be friendly to the eyes, 
                  and finally it should keep your audience to keep coming back to your site.</p><br><br>
