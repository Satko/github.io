        presence whether you are selling products or offering services.</p>
            
          <h2> Local Search Analytics</h2>
          <p>Understand the intent of your target audience:
        you can find this out very easyly, simply put yourself in the same spot as your audince, what are 
        youlooking for, go on google and do a couple of searches with your product or service in mind, 
        add a location with your search querry, for example: best bookstores in nyc, hit enter and do 
        some scouting around, open up a few Google My Business profiles, open up some of their sites, 
        get familiar with what your competition is doing.</p>

          <img data-src="gmb-rank-example.webp" style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" class="lazyload rounded img-fluid" alt="Google My Business Rank">
            
          <p>Next, research your keywords, you can use any keyword research tool to find out what the average 
        search volume is then, make sure that you have implemented these keywords both in your website and 
        listing profile.</p>
            
          <h3>Optimizing your listings</h3>

          <h3>Am I eliglible for a listing profile?</h3>
            
          <div class="citation"><p>
          <p>Eligible businesses

        In order to qualify for a Business Profile on Google, a business must make in-person contact with 
        customers durring its stated hours.
            
        There are some exceptions:</p>
            
          <p>ATMs, video-rental kiosks, and express mail dropboxes are permitted. If you add these locations, 
        you must include contact information for customers to get help. Seasonal businesses, like an 
        ice-skating rink only open in winter months, are eligible. These businesses must display permanent
        signage at their location year-round.Virtual Kitchens are permitted. Virtual Kitchens are 
        professional food preparation and cooking facilities set up to prepare delivery-only meals via 
        third-party services. They are also referred to as Ghost Kitchens and Cloud Kitchens. A Virtual 
        Kitchen should create their Business Profile as a service area business.
            
        Ineligible businesses

        The following businesses are not eligible for a business listing:</p>
            
          <p>Rental or for-sale properties such as vacation homes, model homes, or vacant apartments. 
        Sales or leasing offices, however, are eligible for verification. An ongoing service, class, 
        or meeting at a location that you don't own or have the authority to represent.

          <h3>Google, Bing or Apple? Where to set up my listing?</h3>

          <p>For starters, Google is your best bet, it's the best optimized and user friendly way. And to be 
        honest, Google is the biggest search engine so, that's where most of your traffic will come from. 
        Once you understand the basic princples of how listings work, you can move on to Bing Places or 
        Apple Maps since it's prety much the same principles. But yeah, you can only do Google and you'll 
        be good.</p>

          <h3>How to claim your listings</h3>

          <img data-src="claim-gmb-google-my-business-local-seo.webp" style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" class="lazyload rounded img-fluid" alt="Claim Google My Business Profile">
            

          <p>If you are the owner of a certain physical office, store or a shop that offers services, odds are,
        your business is already on Google. Google uses its users feedback, to enable it to create business
        profiles online automatically, or, any owner of a business can go online and create it himself,
        see below. It can also use information from other sites, like Yelp, Tripadvisor, etc.</p>
            
          <p>To find out if Google has already created a listing for your business, type your store name and 
        address in the search bar, hit enter and voila! If there is one, great, if not, no cause for 
        corncearn, you can create it yourself, which is very simple and straighforward process and takes 
        up obly a few minutes.</p>

          <img data-src="gmb-listing.webp" style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" class="lazyload rounded img-fluid" alt="Google My Business Profile">

          <p>First, if you have the business profile of your store open on Google, go and click on Own this 
        business? link. If the listing hasn't been claimed by anyone else, then you can simply follow the 
        steps and fill in your information and, in about a week(takes longer outside the US), Gooogle will 
        send you a Google My Business postcard that contains a pin number needed to verify that you are 
        indeed the owner of the location, hence gain access to your Google My Business profile.</p>
            
          <h3>what checks to perform as soon as you have verified your listing</h3>
            
        Once you log in, you may check your infromation, make the neccessary changes, and click on the 
        update button.
          <p hidden>ADD IMAGE OF GOOGLE MY BUSINESS VERIFIED PROFILE</p>
            
          <p>Make sure to head into the info tab and check if your name, address, phone number and schedule 
        matches your physical location. Next, when someone searches for a store or business online, 
        they usually like to see photos of the location, what it looks like outside, inside, products, 
        if you offer some. So, once logged in  your Google My Business profile, you can go to Photos, 
        and upload a few clear photos of your bussiness, make sure your profile photo feautures your store
        front, add your logo and add some photos of the inside  or the products that you offer.
        Once that is done, you can go ahead and update your website, if you have one, which at this point, 
        I'm just going to assume you do.</p>
